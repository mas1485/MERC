#Welcome to MERC!

Welcome to my first project which I am both proud and excited to show-off!

My first project is for a running club named MERC (Multi Ethnic Running Club) which is a start-up CIC that is newly launching.

MERC was founded by Raihan Uddin, an experienced runner in my local area who has participated in Ultra Marathons and community projects such as helping the wildlife conservation in Naankuse, South Africa.

MERC aims to provide a space where people can participate in casual runs to improve their fitness, in organized races to fundraise for charities/projects in their local area and engage in social activities. As a whole, MERC aims to bring communities together. Members of MERC will therefore have a wide range of reasons to join and in both small or large ways improve their communities.

MERC is perfect for all types of runners, whether members just want a quick run in the morning before/after work to keep healthy, to compete in organized races, to engage in a social group, to gain experience in leadership positions or to make a difference in their communities and wanting to ensure that local charities get the support they need.

In this project I have used only HTML CSS but have produced a working website for a client and as a result the project includes content and designs tailored to their specifications.

I have held several meetings with the sole director over this project and continued to take new information, make changes and step-up to new ideas or solutions as the work went on.

#General Information

Before we get into the meat of the specific aspects of the site I would like to provide some contextual information which might give explanations for the layout and functionality of the site.

You will find all the html files under the merc folder, with the css file in the css folder under assets.

The assets folder also houses favicon, images and pdfs which were also used in the site creation.

I wanted to build a website that not only works using the current tools but had the potential to improve in the future, the long-term design for this site was a place where the features were interactive and pulled live information from various sources, such as from a company app or social media. I understood that I had to be realistic about what was expected of me in this project and what I could do with the tools I had.

I also had alot of internet issues in which I resorted to using VS Code to tackle so that I could operate offline and then push the code to the repository on GitHub, however, upon using the application code, this attempted to sign in using another account, therefore there is a submission under a separate account however this was done to test that the account changes were completed properly so if you look at the code history this should show the code not being changed but only to set up the push/pull between the applications 'Fork' and 'VS Code' with my account.

#Navigation

The navigation bar is featured on everypage and is complete with a logo, links to the main pages using a burger icon for smaller screens and buttons for users to signup/donate to the club.

When making the burger icons alongside the buttons I had to ensure that the text was re-organised when the user was using different sized devices, therefore I had to ensure that there were two nav elements for the text which was hidden depending on the screen sizes. I created the classes for nav-wide and nav-narrow so that upon the different break-points the content was hidden, giving the current oganisation of the burger button being placed after the buttons on the small screen and the text being placed before the buttons on the large screen.
