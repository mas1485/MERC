#Welcome to MERC!

Welcome to my first project which I am both proud and excited to show-off!

My first project is for a running club named MERC (Multi Ethnic Running Club) which is a start-up CIC that is newly launching.

MERC was founded by Raihan Uddin, an experienced runner in my local area who has participated in Ultra Marathons and community projects such as helping the wildlife conservation in Naankuse, South Africa.

MERC aims to provide a space where people can participate in casual runs to improve their fitness, in organized races to fundraise for charities/projects in their local area and engage in social activities. As a whole, MERC aims to bring communities together. Members of MERC will therefore have a wide range of reasons to join and in both small or large ways improve their communities.

MERC is perfect for all types of runners, whether members just want a quick run in the morning before/after work to keep healthy, to compete in organized races, to engage in a social group, to gain experience in leadership positions or to make a difference in their communities and wanting to ensure that local charities get the support they need.

In this project I have used only HTML CSS but have produced a working website for a client and as a result the project includes content and designs tailored to their specifications.

I have held several meetings with the sole director over this project and continued to take new information, make changes and step-up to new ideas or solutions as the work went on.

#General Information

Before we get into the meat of the specific aspects of the site I would like to provide some contextual information which might give explanations for the layout and functionality of the site.

You will find all the html files under the merc folder, with the css file in the css folder under assets.

The assets folder also houses favicon, images and pdfs which were also used in the site creation.

I used both flex and grid in order to specifically order content where I wanted them to be placed and maintain a visually appealling aspect for the user. Some of the classes have elements vary between flex and grid due to screen size based on the circumstances.

I wanted to build a website that not only works using the current tools but had the potential to improve in the future, the long-term design for this site was a place where the features were interactive and pulled live information from various sources, such as from a company app or social media. I understood that I had to be realistic about what was expected of me in this project and what I could do with the tools I had.

I also had alot of internet issues in which I resorted to using VS Code to tackle so that I could operate offline and then push the code to the repository on GitHub, however, upon using the application code, this attempted to sign in using another account, therefore there is a submission under a separate account however this was done to test that the account changes were completed properly so if you look at the code history this should show the code not being changed but only to set up the push/pull between the applications 'Fork' and 'VS Code' with my account.

The overall design strategy for the website was casual, the client did not want a club that felt out-of-touch, intimidating or pompous, as synonymous with other running clubs, he wanted a running club that people felt comfortable to join and to promote the casual runners who just wanted to run out of fitness or simple enjoyment. Therefore the design strategy was to compliment this aspect so that the user felt this in a subtle way, as not to detract from the idea of professional work which reflects the running club separately from others in the area. As such, the use of colours, images and the writing style of the content, blends both the professional make-up of a business, and the casualness of a social running club.

#Navigation

The navigation bar is featured on everypage and is complete with a logo, links to the main pages using a burger icon for smaller screens and buttons for users to signup/donate to the club.

When making the burger icons alongside the buttons I had to ensure that the text was re-organised when the user was using different sized devices, therefore I had to ensure that there were two nav elements for the text which was hidden depending on the screen sizes. I created the classes for nav-wide and nav-narrow so that upon the different break-points the content was hidden, giving the current oganisation of the burger button being placed after the buttons on the small screen and the text being placed before the buttons on the large screen.

I wanted the logo to be forced to the left, with the rest of the content towards the right-hand side as much as possible, therefore I used a mix between a flex and grid property in order to arrange this layout.

I initially wanted a very interactive nav bar, however with the current tools and timeframe, I could not justify spending large amounts of time doing so using just HTML CSS. Especially if, once I learned other tools, that this work would be totally redundant and therefore spend even more time to readjust. Therefore the navbar I made was both fitting of the site content and allowed further development in an easier fashion to make future changes easier to make.

#Home Page

I wanted the user to feel that the site was interactive and rather than giving them all the information to them all at once, especially as the target for this site was also for current members to keep updated with schedules, events etc, I opted to go for the use of small sections which housed the user could navigate to find the information that they wanted. It would also give the user a chance to visit all the pages of the site as they naturally went along to gather more information about the club.

From the homepage, the key pieces of information that a user may want to know, is easily accessible via the button links, there is also the use of the nav bar, in which houses the mainpages of the site, whilst the button links send the user to subpages of those mainpages.

I wanted a background in the pages, but I did not want that the be the forefront of the website, therefore I applied ample amounts of content and used a gradient background to give the background images a nice effect that looked appealing to the user. Following the design strategy, I also used a variety of colours to help make the site feel exciting and draw the user to the content. The overall colours used by the club was black and blues as can be seen by their logo, however, the client did not want specific club colours as this was feel too restrictive on members, we discussed that, if the strategy was to appeal to casual runners, then the use of multiple colours, alongside the main colours, would help subtly give the impression to the user that the club is not restrictive.

When making the main section with the content, I quickly realised that I wanted to give a visual difference between what I labelled as the 'letter' section (class of gridletter) and the content below that. The gridletter sections will be the interactive sections of the website in future deployments, I wanted the user to be able to see live schedule updates, or social media posts etc as they appear in these 'letters'. As the site was primarily for members, these letter would give members the information that they would most likely wish to see upon visiting the site. It also gives members a reason to continue to visit the site as the information constantly evolves. Right now, they just more than the placeholders, where they simply direct the user to sources of information, but my future plan for this section once I have learned the tools to do so, would be to allow the client and selected members to upload information from their schedules, social media, apps etc to the site displayed onto these letters. As placeholders for future tools, the letters still offered a useful function in breaking up content and keeping the site looking fresh.

In order to help distinguish the above letters from the other pieces of helpful content on the homepage, I used a different style to display the rest of the content, keeping the theme of using a variety of colours. I also wanted to give the user a break from the previous style to keep the site fresh and more appealing. I used fixed images in order to give this part of the homepage a sense of stability, so that the user knew that this section did not have the same type of interactivity as the previous 'letter' section.

As the website evolves, the user will see more and more interactivity with the website, most notably in the 'letter' section and give them an impressionable experience of the site.

#Footer

I wanted the footer to have all the pages listed in the event that future deployments relying on external assets/tools (such as fontawesome or Java) would still allow the site to function and the user to navigate through the pages. There are multiple ways to navigate through the site, whether through the navbar, content or footer, giving the user chances to travel through the site in a meaningful way.
