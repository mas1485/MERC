                        <h4>What does MERC mean?</h4>
                        <p class="info-text">MERC stands for Multi Ethnic Running Club, our vision is to bring communities together.</p>
                        <h4>Are you a charity?</h4>
                        <p class="info-text">No, we are a community interest company, also known as a CIC, we are a not-for-profit organisation that can raise funds by donations, sponsors, investors, retail and merchandise etc. We have more flexibility and are able to engage in both charitable, community and social projects. Our funds cannot be used to pay dividends to shareholders and the owner/founder cannot take profit out. You can check out the government website for an official description of what a CIC is at: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/set-up-a-social-enterprise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.gov.uk/set-up-a-social-enterprise</a></p>
                        <h4>What happens to to money you make?</h4>
                        <p class="info-text">We are looking to engage in a number of services to raise funds, offering merchandise, obtaining grants, sponsors, donations and membership fees. The funds raised are used first and foremostly for charitable and community purposes, with surplus used to expand the club so that we can raise more funds and improve the club for our members.</p>
                        <h4>How are funds allocated?</h4>
                        <p class="info-text">We separate funds based on how they have been raised and for what purpose, we believe that this matches the ethos of our members who may wise to raise funds for causes that they want to target. Therefore, funds raised by means of a 'fundraiser' are specified to that target, such as the HARP24 race in which funds raised go to HARP covering the cost of participating in their race and the rest to whatever HARP decides. Funds raised by membership fees and 'donations' are broadly applied to whatever project or charity the board allocate and surplus funds are re-invested into the company to allow for expansion and cover costs of running an organisation.</p>
                        <h4>Why is alot of the site marked as coming soon?</h4>
                        <p class="info-text">As a start-up CIC which has newly formed in September 2024, there are alot of features and content we are planning to add to the site. We have alot of plans for the future and look to our members to help us grow so that we can provide a service to our community.</p>
                        <h4>Can anyone signup to be a member?</h4>
                        <p class="info-text">Yes, aslong as you are 18 or over you can signup.</p>
                        <h4>Can children join our runs?</h4>
                        <p class="info-text">We do not offer child memberships currently. We allow our members to have their children or younger friends/family to run with them, therefore children must be accompanied by an adult member who is acting as a parent or guardian. Members who take children on a run with them agree to act as parent or guardian and are held responsible for their wellbeing. See our policies for more information.</p>
                        <h4>How much is it to signup?</h4>
                        <p class="info-text">We offer a yearly membership of Â£19.99 starting on the date that you completed the registration. We also offer promotions and a group discount so be on the lookout for deals at our store.</p>
                        <h4>What do I get for signing up?</h4>
                        <p class="info-text">All new members get a club shirt bearing our logo, to see how it looks check out our membership and store pages.</p>
                        <h4>Do captains get paid?</h4>
                        <p class="info-text">No, captains, just like members, are not paid. None of the board members recieve a salary and cannot recieve dividends or get paid by shares as covered by our constitution. There are no plans to offer wages and we are aiming to maintain a club consisting of volunteers.</p>
                        <h4>Why should I donate to MERC and not straight with the charity?</h4>
                        <p class="info-text">We track contributions made by our members, including how much they have raised, we reward contributions with points that members can use at our store. We also offer occassional promotions for our fundraisers, matching the contributions of our members. There are also projects that may not be covered by an existing charity, meaning we have flexibility to tackle issues that matter in our community very quickly.</p>
